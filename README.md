Classwork Week 7 Day 1 - Component based UI
===

Implement the `Header` Component.

- Ensure that it works in Storybook first;
- Then ensure it works as part of App

The focus of this exercise is not about styling, so don't sweat it if it does not look as neat as you want.

Focus on getting it rendered without error.

Enjoy.
